## Summary

   >Hello, my friend! Back in 2000, I got interested in programming, but then I was young and resisted the voice of my heart. Twenty years after, having a completely different profession, increasing the degree of awareness, I recalled what I really wanted. And here I am now! For a year now, I've been gaining knowledge and I really like it! Every day I'm getting stronger, smarter and more promising! I'm sure I'll become a professional in this interesting and overwhelming sphere!
